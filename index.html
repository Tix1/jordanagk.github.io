    <h2>Helvetica / Medium</h2>
    <p>Helvetica was designed by Max Miedinger and Eduard Hoffmann and released in 1957 by the Haas Type Foundry in Münchenstein, Switzerland (<a href="http://www.giphy.com">Helvetica</a>). Helvetica was a favorite of Massimo Vignelli, one of the founders of Unimark International that redesigned the entire New York City wayfinding system in the 1960s and 70s (<a href="https://www.ceros.com/originals/massimo-vignelli-nyc-subway/">How</a>).This popularity and Helvetica’s accent to the forefront of design history is the reason I chose this font.</p>
